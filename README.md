# Event Finder

This project allows users to search for events in the vicinity of the chosen city. [Discovery API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/) has been used to provide information about events e.g. date and place.

React and Bootstrap have been used to develop the website. [Append](https://bootstrapmade.com/append-bootstrap-website-template/) template has been adapted into a React app by dividing the page into components and converting plain JavaScript into React Hooks.

The project has been deployed on [GitHub](https://majagrys.github.io/Event-Finder/).
