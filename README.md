The project has been developed using React, Redux, Bootstrap and [Discovery API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/). Design has been inspired by the [Append](https://bootstrapmade.com/append-bootstrap-website-template/) template. Additionally, [react-loader-spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loader-spinner) and [react-zoom-pan-pinch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-zoom-pan-pinch) packages have been used to implement the loading spinner and the world map. Testing have been conducted using Jest and Cypress.
